  Hello! I'm Isadora, and this is my GitHub. Recently, I transitioned into the world of technology, bringing with me a background in nursing and experience working in hospitals. 
  I've been on this exciting journey for a while now, diving into various tools and workflows, and I'm thrilled to share my projects and progress here. 
  I'm constantly seeking to learn and grow, and I'm passionate about leveraging technology to make a positive impact. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out to me for any questions or collaboration!
